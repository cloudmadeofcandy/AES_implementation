# AES_implementation
AES Encryption and Decryption implementation for CT303 - Basis of Information Integrity and Security - Academy of Cryptography Techniques.

To use the program, please pay attention to the 2 functions/APIs in file AES.py.

The function aesEncrypt(state, cypherkey), takes 2 arguments: 
  - state: a plaintext of unknown length.
  - cypherkey: another string, serves as the input for the keyExpansion stage.

The function should return a cyphertext.

The function aesDecrypt(state, cypherkey), takes 2 arguments: 
  - state: a plaintext of unknown length.
  - cypherkey: another string, serves as the input for the keyExpansion stage.

The function should return the plaintext.
